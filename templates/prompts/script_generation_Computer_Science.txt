Generate engaging audio revision script for Grade {{grade_band}} Computer Science students.

CONTEXT:
Two students - {{speaker1_name}} and {{speaker2_name}} - are helping YOU (the listener) revise at home.
You studied this already but want to REFRESH understanding before coding practice.

INPUTS:
- Concepts: {{concepts}} 
  (Each concept has: real_world_analogy, debugging_tips, common_misconceptions, implementation_note)
- Duration: {{duration_minutes}} minutes ({{duration_seconds}} seconds)
- Target Words: {{min_words}}-{{target_words}} (~150 words/minute)
- Source: {{chapter_content}}
- Episode: #{{episode_number}} - {{episode_title}}

COMPUTER SCIENCE FOCUS:
- Explain LOGIC and THINKING, not code syntax
- Use real-world analogies: "It's like when you..."
- Explain WHY algorithms work, not just memorize steps
- Address debugging: "Common mistake: forgetting to..."
- End each concept: "Now go code this yourself to practice"

CRITICAL: NO CODE WALKTHROUGHS
❌ DON'T: "Line 1: int x equals 5, line 2: if x greater than..."
✅ DO: "The algorithm checks if value is greater than threshold, then takes action"
✅ DO: "Think of it like searching for a name in a phonebook - you don't start at A if looking for Z"

ENGAGEMENT FRAMEWORK:

1. USE ANALOGIES from real life:
   - Binary search → Dictionary lookup, phonebook search
   - Recursion → Russian nesting dolls, mirrors reflecting mirrors
   - Variables → Labeled boxes, storage containers
   - Loops → Doing homework problems repeatedly
   - Arrays → Row of lockers, egg carton

2. EXPLAIN THE "WHY":
   - "Binary search is fast BECAUSE it eliminates half the options each time"
   - "We use functions to avoid repeating code - imagine copying same homework solution 50 times!"

3. ADDRESS COMMON BUGS:
   - Use concept's debugging_tips
   - "Classic mistake: off-by-one error - loop goes one too far"
   - "Watch out for: infinite loops when condition never becomes false"

4. ENCOURAGE PRACTICE:
   - Use concept's implementation_note
   - "Okay, now pause this and try coding it yourself"
   - "Write a simple version first, then make it complex"

DIALOGUE REQUIREMENTS:

NATURAL CONVERSATION:
- NOT robotic code reading
- Explain concepts like talking to a friend
- "So basically, the idea is..."
- "Think of it this way..."
- Contractions: "it's", "don't", "you're"
- Reactions: "Ohh that makes sense!", "Wait, so..."

SPEAKER ROLES:
- {{speaker1_name}}: Explains concepts, enthusiastic about logic
- {{speaker2_name}}: Asks "why" questions, makes connections
- Address listener: "When you code this later, remember..."

PACING BY IMPORTANCE:
- importance=5: Slow down, multiple analogies, explain thoroughly
- importance=3-4: Clear explanation, one good analogy
- importance=1-2: Quick mention

STRUCTURE:
Opening (30-40s): Set context
  "{{speaker1_name}}: Let's revise [topic] before you start coding"
  "{{speaker2_name}}: Yeah, I want to make sure I understand the logic first"

Main Content: Cover all concepts
  - Focus on WHY and HOW it works
  - Real-world analogies
  - Common pitfalls
  - "Now go implement this"

Ending (20-30s): Encourage practice
  "Remember, programming is learned by DOING - go write code now!"
  "Start simple, then add features"

OUTPUT CONSTRAINTS:
- Duration: {{duration_minutes}} minutes ({{duration_seconds}} seconds)
- Word count: {{min_words}}-{{target_words}} words (~150 words/minute)
- Format: Conversational dialogue alternating {{speaker1_name}} and {{speaker2_name}}
- NO code syntax walkthroughs - concepts and logic only
