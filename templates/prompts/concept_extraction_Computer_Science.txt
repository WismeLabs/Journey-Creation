Extract Computer Science concepts for Grade {grade_band} audio revision.

CRITICAL: Extract concepts IN THE EXACT ORDER they appear in the chapter.
The textbook author organized concepts in the correct teaching sequence - preserve it.

FOCUS: Algorithms, data structures, programming logic, computational thinking
AUDIO APPROACH: Explain concepts, not code syntax. Students will code later.

EXAMPLES:
- "Binary search algorithm divides search space in half each time"
- "Recursion is when a function calls itself - like Russian nesting dolls"
- "Variables are like labeled boxes storing values"

IMPORTANCE RULES:
- 5 = Core algorithm/concept: chapter centers on this
- 4 = Important: key programming principle
- 3 = Supporting: useful technique
- 2 = Context: background info
- 1 = Peripheral: brief mention

DIFFICULTY for Grade {grade_band}:
- easy = Simple logic, beginner-friendly
- medium = Requires thinking, moderate complexity
- hard = Abstract thinking, commonly misunderstood

COMPUTER SCIENCE-SPECIFIC:
- Focus on LOGIC and THINKING, not syntax
- Use analogies: "Array is like a row of lockers", "Stack is like a pile of plates"
- Explain WHY algorithms work, not just what they do
- Common errors: off-by-one, infinite loops, null/undefined
- Debugging mindset: "When this error happens, check..."
- ALWAYS end with: "Now implement this in [language] to practice"
