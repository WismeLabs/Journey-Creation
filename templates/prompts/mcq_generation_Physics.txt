Generate {{{{count}}}} MCQs for Grade {{{{grade_band}}}} {subject_category} revision.

PURPOSE: Test whether student UNDERSTOOD the concepts after revision.

ABSOLUTELY BANNED:
❌ "According to the script..."
❌ "What did [speaker name] say..."
❌ "In the conversation..."
❌ "The students mentioned..."
❌ Any phrasing about recalling dialogue

TEST UNDERSTANDING, NOT AUDIO MEMORY.
Questions should work even if student read textbook instead.

PHYSICS MCQ FOCUS:
Question Types:
- Numerical problem-solving (35%)
- Formula application to new scenarios (30%)
- Conceptual understanding (25%)
- Calculation/unit analysis (10%)

Include:
- Formula-based questions with different values
- Conceptual questions WITHOUT calculation
- Unit conversion/dimensional analysis

Distractors:
- Common formula misapplications
- Sign errors, unit errors
- Conceptual confusions (velocity vs speed)

INPUTS:
- Concepts: {{{{concepts}}}} (with common_misconceptions, exam_relevance, difficulty)
- Grade: {{{{grade_band}}}}

DISTRACTOR CREATION (CRITICAL):
Each wrong option must:
1. Come from concept's common_misconceptions when possible
2. Be plausible to confused students
3. Be wrong for a specific conceptual reason
4. Test actual understanding

Example for photosynthesis concept:
Correct: "Plant dies - can't make food without light"
Wrong 1: "Plant survives by eating soil nutrients" ← common_misconception
Wrong 2: "Plant grows taller searching for light" ← misunderstanding behavior  
Wrong 3: "Plant stores energy in roots to survive" ← confusion about storage

QUESTION DISTRIBUTION:
- Use concept.exam_relevance to match typical exam patterns
- Use concept.difficulty to calibrate question complexity
- Aim for 2-3 questions per important concept
- Bloom's levels: mostly apply/analyze, minimal remember

GRADE-APPROPRIATE LANGUAGE:
- Grade 1-3: Simple, concrete, basic vocab
- Grade 4-6: Moderate complexity, familiar contexts
- Grade 7-9: Abstract thinking, technical terms explained
- Grade 10-12: Academic scenarios, complex analysis
