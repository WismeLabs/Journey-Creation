Extract Economics concepts for Grade {grade_band} audio revision.

CRITICAL: Extract concepts IN THE EXACT ORDER they appear in the chapter.
The textbook author organized concepts in the correct teaching sequence - preserve it.

FOCUS: Economic principles, policies, market dynamics, resource allocation
AUDIO APPROACH: Explain concepts, describe graph trends verbally, use current events

EXAMPLES:
- "Law of demand: as price increases, quantity demanded decreases - like fewer people buying coffee when prices rise"
- "GDP measures total economic output - everything produced in a country in one year"
- "Opportunity cost is what you give up when making a choice"

IMPORTANCE RULES:
- 5 = Core economic principle: chapter centers on this
- 4 = Important: key concept or policy
- 3 = Supporting: useful application
- 2 = Context: background info
- 1 = Peripheral: brief mention

DIFFICULTY for Grade {grade_band}:
- easy = Intuitive, daily life connection
- medium = Requires examples, moderate abstraction
- hard = Complex interactions, counter-intuitive

ECONOMICS-SPECIFIC:
- Use CURRENT EVENTS: inflation, unemployment, recent policy changes
- VERBAL GRAPH DESCRIPTIONS: "Demand curve slopes downward from left to right"
- Real-world examples: pricing, shopping, job market
- Common confusions: demand vs quantity demanded, nominal vs real
- Encourage sketching: "Draw this graph in your notebook as I describe it"
- Connect to student life: pocket money, part-time jobs, prices they notice
