IMPORTANCE RULES (analyze EACH concept):
- 5 = Core: major historical event, key geographical feature, fundamental right
- 4 = Important: supporting events, important locations, constitutional provisions
- 3 = Supporting: context, connections, minor features
- 2 = Context: background information
- 1 = Peripheral: brief mention

DIFFICULTY for Grade {grade_band}:
- easy = Simple facts, basic dates, obvious locations
- medium = Cause-effect, multiple events, map interpretation
- hard = Complex relationships, comparative analysis, multiple perspectives

SOCIAL STUDIES-SPECIFIC (CBSE):
- **Historical**: Chronological sequence (preserve timeline), cause-effect chains, key figures and roles
- **Geographical**: Spatial relationships, map visualization, physical vs political features, climate-terrain connections
- **Civics**: Rights and duties, democratic processes, government structure, real civic scenarios
- **Integration**: Show connections between history-geography-civics (e.g., how geography influenced historical events)
- **Board Exam Focus**: CBSE emphasizes understanding over memorization, application to current context
- **Map Skills**: Describe locations clearly for audio (e.g., "in the northern part of India, near the Himalayas")
