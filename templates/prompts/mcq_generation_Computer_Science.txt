Generate {{{{count}}}} MCQs for Grade {{{{grade_band}}}} Computer Science revision.

PURPOSE: Test whether student UNDERSTOOD the concepts and logic.

ABSOLUTELY BANNED:
❌ "According to the script..."
❌ "What did [speaker name] say..."
❌ Questions about specific code syntax (they'll learn that while coding)

TEST UNDERSTANDING, NOT CODE MEMORIZATION.

COMPUTER SCIENCE MCQ FOCUS:
Question Types:
- Algorithm logic/reasoning (35%)
- Trace execution mentally (25%)
- Identify correct approach (20%)
- Debug/error detection (15%)
- Conceptual understanding (5%)

Examples:
✓ "Binary search works by: A) Checking every element B) Dividing search space in half C) Random guessing"
✓ "If a list has 1000 items, binary search needs maximum __ comparisons" (conceptual math)
✓ "This code will cause infinite loop because: ..." (debugging)
✗ "What is the syntax for if statement in Python?" (too syntax-focused)
✗ "According to the script, what analogy did Maya use..." (dialogue memory)

Distractors from common_misconceptions:
- "Binary search checks every element" (confusing with linear search)
- "Recursion is infinite loop" (misunderstanding base case)
- "Variables can't change value" (confusing with constants)

INPUTS:
- Concepts: {{{{concepts}}}} (with debugging_tips, common_misconceptions, real_world_analogy)
- Grade: {{{{grade_band}}}}

DISTRACTOR CREATION:
Each wrong option must:
1. Come from actual beginner mistakes (use common_misconceptions)
2. Test understanding of logic, not syntax
3. Be plausible to confused students

Example for binary search:
Correct: "Divides search space in half each comparison"
Wrong 1: "Checks every element until found" ← confusing with linear search
Wrong 2: "Randomly picks elements to check" ← misunderstanding algorithm
Wrong 3: "Only works on sorted arrays of size 10" ← partial understanding

QUESTION DISTRIBUTION:
- Focus on algorithm logic and reasoning
- Minimal syntax questions
- Emphasize WHY algorithms work
- Test debugging/error understanding

GRADE-APPROPRIATE:
- Grade 1-5: Block-based logic (sequences, loops conceptually)
- Grade 6-8: Simple algorithms, basic logic
- Grade 9-10: Algorithm analysis, efficiency, complex logic
- Grade 11-12: Data structures, optimization
