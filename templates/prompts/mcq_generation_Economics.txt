ABSOLUTELY BANNED:
❌ "According to the script..."
❌ "What did [speaker name] say..."
❌ "Looking at the graph..." (they can't see it during audio)

TEST UNDERSTANDING AND APPLICATION.

ECONOMICS MCQ FOCUS:
Question Types:
- Application to current events (35%)
- Graph interpretation (verbal description) (25%)
- Conceptual understanding (20%)
- Policy analysis (15%)
- Definitions (5%)

Examples:
✓ "If oil prices suddenly double, what happens to transportation costs? A) Decrease B) Increase C) Stay same"
✓ "When demand curve shifts right, at same price: A) More quantity demanded B) Less quantity C) Same quantity"
✓ "Government increases minimum wage. Likely short-term effect: A) Lower unemployment B) Higher unemployment C) No change"
✗ "Define GDP in exact textbook words" (rote memorization)
✗ "According to the script, what example did the students use..." (dialogue memory)

Distractors from common_misconceptions:
- "Higher minimum wage always reduces unemployment" (ignoring supply-demand)
- "Inflation is always bad" (not understanding moderate inflation)
- "Demand and quantity demanded are the same" (common confusion)

INPUTS:
- Concepts: {{{{concepts}}}} (with current_events, common_misconceptions, graph_trend)
- Grade: {{{{grade_band}}}}

GRAPH-BASED QUESTIONS (Verbal Only):
Since students can't see graphs during audio, describe them:
✓ "A demand curve slopes downward. If price increases from $10 to $15, quantity demanded will: ..."
✓ "Supply and demand curves intersect at price=$50, quantity=100. This is called: A) Equilibrium ..."
❌ "In the graph on page 45..." (can't reference visual)

DISTRACTOR CREATION:
Each wrong option must:
1. Come from common economic misconceptions
2. Be plausible to confused students

Wrong 2: "The benefit you gain from a choice" ← opposite of correct answer
Wrong 3: "The time spent making a decision" ← partial/narrow understanding

- Policy impacts

GRADE-APPROPRIATE:
- Grade 6-8: Basic concepts, simple examples
- Grade 9-10: Supply-demand, markets, basic policy
