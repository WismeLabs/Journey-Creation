Generate engaging audio revision script for Grade {grade_band} students.

CONTEXT:
Two students - {speaker1_name} and {speaker2_name} - are helping YOU (the listener) revise at home.
You studied this already but want to REFRESH memory, CLARIFY doubts, and REMEMBER well.

INPUTS:
- Concepts: {concepts} 
  (Each concept has: importance, difficulty, memory_hooks, common_misconceptions, key_points)
- Duration: {duration_minutes} minutes ({duration_seconds} seconds)
- Target Words: {min_words}-{target_words} (~150 words/minute)
- Source: {chapter_content}
- Episode: #{episode_number} - {episode_title}

GENERAL FOCUS:
- Clear explanations appropriate for this subject
- Examples students can relate to
- Address common misunderstandings
- Make concepts memorable

ENGAGEMENT FRAMEWORK:

1. USE HUMOR intelligently:
   - When concept has humor_potential="high"
   - Funny analogies that AID MEMORY
   - NOT forced jokes, only when genuinely helpful

2. USE MEMORY HOOKS from concepts:
   - Share mnemonics naturally: "Here's a trick to remember..."
   - Explain WHY it works
   - Make it seem helpful, not cheesy

3. ADDRESS MISCONCEPTIONS explicitly:
   - Have one student voice the common misconception
   - Other clarifies the confusion clearly
   - Pattern: "Wait, I used to think [wrong]..." "Actually, here's what's really happening..."

4. USE RELATABLE EXAMPLES:
   - From student's actual daily life
   - Make abstract → concrete
   - Age-appropriate references

DIALOGUE REQUIREMENTS:

NATURAL CONVERSATION:
- NOT robotic ping-pong (A-B-A-B)
- Let speakers explain in multiple sentences
- Natural interruptions: "Oh wait!", "Hold on..."
- Reactions: "Ohh!", "That makes sense!", "Wait what?"
- Contractions: "it's", "don't", "you're", "can't"
- Thinking sounds: "Hmm...", "Um...", "Like..."
- Enthusiasm: "This is cool!", "Check this out!"

SPEAKER ROLES:
- {speaker1_name}: Often explains, enthusiastic, confident
- {speaker2_name}: Asks questions, makes connections, curious
- Address listener: "Make sure you remember...", "You probably learned this but..."

PACING BY IMPORTANCE:
- importance=5: Slow down, multiple examples, check understanding
- importance=3-4: Clear explanation, one good example
- importance=1-2: Quick mention, efficient coverage

STRUCTURE:
Opening (30-40s): Start with energy
  "{speaker1_name}: Hey! Ready to revise [topic]?"
  "{speaker2_name}: Yeah, let's make sure I remember this..."

Main Content: Cover all concepts
  - Follow importance-based pacing
  - Use concept metadata (hooks, misconceptions, examples)
  - Natural conversation flow

Ending (20-30s): Quick recap
  "So basically, remember: [2-3 key points]"
  "You got this!"

SOURCE ACCURACY (CRITICAL):
- Every fact MUST reference source: "pX:lines Y-Z"
- If inferring/simplifying, mark "inferred": true
- NEVER state unsourced facts confidently

VALIDATION CHECKLIST:
✓ ALL concepts covered thoroughly
✓ Word count: {min_words}-{target_words}
✓ Duration: ~{duration_minutes} minutes
✓ All facts sourced or marked inferred
✓ Natural Grade {grade_band} language
✓ Engaging (humor, examples, misconceptions addressed)
✓ No dialogue memory questions setup
