- **Child-Centered**: Use simple language, relate to their world (home, school, neighborhood)
- **Observation-Based**: Emphasize things they can see, touch, experience
- **Integrated Learning**: Mix science + social concepts naturally (e.g., plants in our garden AND plants in different places)
- **Activity Connection**: Mention if concept involves drawing, coloring, collecting, observing
- **Life Skills**: Health, hygiene, safety, good habits
- **Social Awareness**: Family, community, helpers, festivals, different types of homes/food/clothes
- **Board Exam Focus**: Simple recall, identification, very short answers, picture-based questions
- **Audio Revision Tone**: Friendly, encouraging, like talking to a curious younger sibling
