Generate engaging audio revision script for Grade {grade_band} Social Studies (CBSE).

CONTEXT:
Two students - {speaker1_name} and {speaker2_name} - are helping YOU (the listener) revise Social Studies at home.
Social Studies combines History, Geography, and Civics - the chapter may cover any or all of these.

INPUTS:
- Concepts: {concepts}
- Duration: {duration_minutes} minutes ({duration_seconds} seconds)
- Target Words: {min_words}-{target_words}
- Source: {chapter_content}
- Episode: #{episode_number} - {episode_title}

AUDIO-FIRST APPROACH (CRITICAL):
🎯 PURPOSE: Revise integrated HISTORY+GEOGRAPHY+CIVICS through stories and concepts. Maps/timelines sketched separately.

✅ DO:
- Historical storytelling: events, chronology, cause-effect
- Spatial descriptions: "The Ganges flows from Himalayas through plains to Bay of Bengal"
- Civic concepts: rights, governance, democratic processes
- Integration: "This geographical feature affected historical events because..."
- Guide sketching: "Sketch this as I explain: timeline on left, map on right"
- End with: "Now create a combined timeline-map showing these events and locations"

❌ DON'T:
- Detailed map coordinates or measurements
- Try to replace actual map labeling practice
- Treat as three separate subjects (integrate!)

💡 INSTEAD SAY:
- "Mark these historical battle locations on your map"
- "Draw a timeline and add geographical context to each event"
- "Practice: which regions had which governments at this time?"

SOCIAL STUDIES FOCUS (CBSE):
- **Historical Content**: Chronological flow, cause-effect relationships, key figures and their roles, significance and impact, connections to present day
- **Geographical Content**: Spatial descriptions (audio-friendly: "in the north near mountains"), physical features, climate patterns, map visualization through words, human-environment interaction
- **Civics Content**: Rights and duties, democratic processes, government structure, real-life civic applications, why it matters in democracy
- **Integrated Approach**: Show connections (e.g., how geography influenced historical events, how history shaped current civic structure)
- **Board Exam Style**: CBSE emphasizes understanding and application, not rote memorization

ENGAGEMENT FRAMEWORK:

1. USE HUMOR when helpful:
   - Historical anecdotes that are memorable
   - Geography: funny regional differences, surprising facts
   - Civics: relatable democratic scenarios

2. USE MEMORY HOOKS:
   - Chronology: "Remember the order: First this, then that..."
   - Geography: "Think of the map: If you're facing north..."
   - Civics: "Three branches like three legs of a stool"

3. ADDRESS MISCONCEPTIONS:
   - Date confusions, location errors
   - Rights vs Duties mix-ups
   - Cause vs Effect confusion

4. USE RELATABLE EXAMPLES:
   - Current events, local geography
   - School elections for democracy
   - News headlines connecting to history

DIALOGUE REQUIREMENTS:
- NATURAL CONVERSATION (not robotic)
- Mix historical storytelling, map descriptions, civic discussions
- "Wait, so FIRST this happened, THEN that?"
- "If you look at a map..." (describe spatially)
- "This is why we have this right today..."

PACING:
- importance=5: Major events, key features, fundamental rights - slow down
- importance=3-4: Supporting facts - clear explanation
- importance=1-2: Quick context

CBSE BOARD ALIGNMENT:
- 3-mark questions: Cause-effect, significance
- 5-mark questions: Detailed explanations, comparisons
- Map work: Locations described clearly
