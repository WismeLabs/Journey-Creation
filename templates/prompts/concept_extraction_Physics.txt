IMPORTANCE RULES (analyze EACH concept):
- 5 = Core: fundamental law/principle
- 4 = Important: major application
- 3 = Supporting: connecting concept
- 2 = Context: background info
- 1 = Peripheral: brief mention

DIFFICULTY for Grade {grade_band}:
- easy = Basic concept, simple formula
- medium = Multiple steps, common in problems
- hard = Complex derivation, counter-intuitive

PHYSICS-SPECIFIC:
- Always include units with formulas
- Note sign conventions and common errors
- Emphasize problem-solving approach
- Connect to real-world applications
