Generate engaging audio revision script for Grade {{grade_band}} Economics students.

CONTEXT:
Two students - {{speaker1_name}} and {{speaker2_name}} - are helping YOU (the listener) revise at home.
You studied this already but want to REFRESH understanding, especially graph interpretations.

INPUTS:
- Concepts: {{concepts}} 
  (Each concept has: graph_trend, current_events, relatable_examples, sketch_note)
- Duration: {{duration_minutes}} minutes ({{duration_seconds}} seconds)
- Target Words: {{min_words}}-{{target_words}} (~150 words/minute)
- Source: {{chapter_content}}
- Episode: #{{episode_number}} - {{episode_title}}

ECONOMICS FOCUS:
- Explain principles using CURRENT EVENTS and REAL prices
- DESCRIBE GRAPHS VERBALLY: "Imagine a graph: X-axis is price, Y-axis is quantity..."
- Use relatable examples: phone prices, food delivery apps, job hunting
- Encourage sketching: "Grab your notebook and draw this as I describe it"
- Connect theory to news: inflation, unemployment, policy changes

GRAPH DESCRIPTIONS (Critical for Audio):
Use concept's graph_trend to guide verbal descriptions:
✓ "The demand curve slopes downward - high price at top left, low price at bottom right"
✓ "As you move right on the graph, quantity increases but price decreases"
✓ "The curves intersect at equilibrium - that's where supply equals demand"
✓ "Sketch this: X-axis is quantity, Y-axis is price, draw a downward sloping line"

❌ DON'T: "Look at the graph on page 45..." (they can't see it)
✅ DO: "Picture this graph in your mind, or better - sketch it now"

ENGAGEMENT FRAMEWORK:

1. USE CURRENT EVENTS:
   - Use concept's current_events
   - "Remember when petrol prices jumped last month? That's supply shock"
   - "Netflix raising prices - perfect example of market power"
   - "Unemployment numbers you hear on news - that's measured like this"

2. RELATABLE EXAMPLES:
   - Phone pricing, food delivery fees, movie tickets
   - Part-time job wages, pocket money decisions
   - "You've noticed [product] got expensive - that's inflation"

3. GRAPH VERBAL GUIDANCE:
   - Use concept's sketch_note
   - "Okay, if you have paper handy, sketch along with me..."
   - "X-axis: price from 0 to 100, Y-axis: quantity..."
   - "Draw a line going DOWN from top-left to bottom-right"

4. POLICY CONNECTIONS:
   - Government decisions students hear about
   - Tax changes, subsidies, minimum wage
   - "When government does [X], here's what happens economically..."

DIALOGUE REQUIREMENTS:

NATURAL CONVERSATION:
- Talk like discussing news, not textbook
- "So basically, when prices go up..."
- "Think about when you shop online..."
- Contractions: "it's", "don't", "you're"
- Reactions: "Exactly!", "Wait that's interesting..."

SPEAKER ROLES:
- {{speaker1_name}}: Explains economic principles, connects to news
- {{speaker2_name}}: Asks "why" questions, shares observations
- Address listener: "You probably noticed prices changing, right?"

PACING BY IMPORTANCE:
- importance=5: Slow down, multiple real examples, describe graph carefully
- importance=3-4: Clear explanation, one current event example
- importance=1-2: Quick mention

STRUCTURE:
Opening (30-40s): Connect to real world
  "{{speaker1_name}}: Let's revise [topic] - you've been seeing this in news lately"
  "{{speaker2_name}}: Yeah, like when [current event]?"

Main Content: Cover all concepts
  - Real-world examples first
  - Then explain principle
  - Describe graphs verbally (encourage sketching)
  - Connect to policy/news

Ending (20-30s): Summarize with current context
  "So next time you hear about [economic news], you'll understand what's really happening"
  "Key takeaway: [principle] affects [daily life]"

OUTPUT CONSTRAINTS:
- Duration: {{duration_minutes}} minutes ({{duration_seconds}} seconds)
- Word count: {{min_words}}-{{target_words}} words (~150 words/minute)
- Format: Conversational dialogue alternating {{speaker1_name}} and {{speaker2_name}}
- MUST verbally describe any graphs - assume listener can't see them
