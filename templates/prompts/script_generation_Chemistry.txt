Generate engaging audio revision script for Grade {{grade_band}} students.

CONTEXT:
Two students - {{speaker1_name}} and {{speaker2_name}} - are helping YOU (the listener) revise at home.
You studied this already but want to REFRESH memory, CLARIFY doubts, and REMEMBER well.

INPUTS:
- Concepts: {{concepts}} 
  (Each concept has: importance, difficulty, memory_hooks, common_misconceptions, key_points)
- Duration: {{duration_minutes}} minutes ({{duration_seconds}} seconds)
- Target Words: {{min_words}}-{{target_words}} (~150 words/minute)
- Source: {{chapter_content}}
- Episode: #{{episode_number}} - {{episode_title}}

AUDIO-FIRST APPROACH (CRITICAL):
🎯 PURPOSE: Revise CONCEPTS, REACTIONS, and CALCULATION STRATEGIES. Equations/numericals done separately.

✅ DO:
- Explain reactions: what happens, why it happens, conditions needed
- Calculation patterns: "For stoichiometry, always start with balanced equation, then mole ratios"
- Conceptual understanding: why reactions occur, what factors affect rate
- Common errors: "Students often forget to balance equations first"
- End with: "Now practice balancing 20 equations and solving mole problems"

❌ DON'T:
- Walk through specific calculations: "2 moles times 18 equals..." (tedious in audio)
- Describe apparatus setups in detail
- Try to show equation balancing step-by-step

💡 INSTEAD SAY:
- "You'll need to practice drawing apparatus diagrams for practicals"
- "Practice balancing equations - start with simple ones"
- "Solve numerical problems to get comfortable with mole concept"

CHEMISTRY FOCUS:
- Chemical equations and balancing
- Reaction types and conditions
- Household chemistry examples
- Safety considerations where relevant
- Common confusions: ionic vs covalent, atom vs molecule, element vs compound

ENGAGEMENT FRAMEWORK:

1. USE HUMOR intelligently:
   - When concept has humor_potential="high"
   - Funny analogies that AID MEMORY
   - Examples: "Mitochondria - basically the cell's battery", "Atoms are drama queens wanting 8 electrons"
   - NOT forced jokes, only when genuinely helpful

2. USE MEMORY HOOKS from concepts:
   - Share mnemonics naturally: "Here's a trick to remember..."
   - Explain WHY it works
   - Make it seem helpful, not cheesy

3. ADDRESS MISCONCEPTIONS explicitly:
   - Have one student voice the common misconception
   - Other clarifies the confusion clearly
   - Emphasize DIFFERENCE between wrong and right
   - Pattern: "Wait, I used to think [wrong]..." "Actually, here's what's really happening..."

4. USE RELATABLE EXAMPLES:
   - From student's actual daily life (phones, social media, sports, food)
   - Make abstract → concrete
   - Age-appropriate references

DIALOGUE REQUIREMENTS:

NATURAL CONVERSATION:
- NOT robotic ping-pong (A-B-A-B)
- Let speakers explain in multiple sentences
- Natural interruptions: "Oh wait!", "Hold on..."
- Reactions: "Ohh!", "That makes sense!", "Wait what?"
- Contractions: "it's", "don't", "you're", "can't"
- Thinking sounds: "Hmm...", "Um...", "Like..."
- Enthusiasm: "This is cool!", "Check this out!"

SPEAKER ROLES:
- {{speaker1_name}}: Often explains, enthusiastic, confident
- {{speaker2_name}}: Asks questions, makes connections, curious
- Address listener: "Make sure you remember...", "You probably learned this but..."

PACING BY IMPORTANCE:
- importance=5: Slow down, multiple examples, check understanding
- importance=3-4: Clear explanation, one good example
- importance=1-2: Quick mention, efficient coverage

STRUCTURE:
Opening (30-40s): Start with energy
  "{{speaker1_name}}: Hey! Ready to revise [topic]?"
  "{{speaker2_name}}: Yeah, let's make sure I remember this..."

Main Content: Cover all concepts
  - Follow importance-based pacing
  - Use concept metadata (hooks, misconceptions, examples)
  - Natural conversation flow

Ending (20-30s): Quick recap
  "So basically, remember: [2-3 key points]"
  "You got this!"

SOURCE ACCURACY (CRITICAL):
- Every fact MUST reference source: "pX:lines Y-Z"
- If inferring/simplifying, mark "inferred": true
- NEVER state unsourced facts confidently

VALIDATION CHECKLIST:
✓ ALL concepts covered thoroughly
✓ Word count: {{min_words}}-{{target_words}}
✓ Duration: ~{{duration_minutes}} minutes
✓ All facts sourced or marked inferred
✓ Natural Grade {{grade_band}} language
✓ Engaging (humor, examples, misconceptions addressed)
✓ No dialogue memory questions setup
